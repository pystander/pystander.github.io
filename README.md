# My Personal Website
A static portfolio website made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).


## About
This website was originally based on an online boilerplate with pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and is now migrated to Jekyll for its simple and maintainable design.
